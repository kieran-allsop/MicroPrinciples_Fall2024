## Principles of Microeconomics @ Johns Hopkins - Section 4, Fall 2024

This repository stores all slides and practice problems for sessions throughout the semester. Slides will generally be posted after the session. Practice problems will generally be posted a week in advance so that students can come to the Friday session with questions

Serious thanks goes to John Green for providing all of the source material and practice problems.
